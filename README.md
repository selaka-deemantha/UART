# UART
 UART Module in Verilog: This repository includes a Verilog implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) for asynchronous serial communication. It features separate transmitter and receiver modules, supports configurable baud rates, and handles various data formats. Ideal for integrating serial communication into FPGA or digital designs.
